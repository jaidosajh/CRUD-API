Step 1: Installing the necessary Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install Flask and SQLAlchemy libraries. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command

###  pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy

Step 2: Create a new Python File

Step 3: Set Up the Database
The code is set to use a SQLite database. To create the database file and necessary tables, you can add the following code snippet after the line db = SQLAlchemy(app) in your app.py file:
# Create the database tables (run once)
db.create_all()

Step 4: Run the API Server
#use the following command
python app.py

This will start the Flask development server and you should be able to see output similar to the following:
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Step 5: Interacting with the created API
You can use a tool like cURL or Postman to interact with the API by sending HTTP requests to the defined endpoints. Here are some examples of HTTP requests you can make:

##### To list all the books:
GET http://localhost:5000/books

##### To get information about a specific book by book id: ( example book id= 1)
GET http://localhost:5000/books/1

##### To create a new book in the directory:
POST http://localhost:5000/books

Request body:
{
  "title": "New Book",
  "author": "New Author",
  "published_date": "2023-07-18"
}

##### To update an existing book:
PUT http://localhost:5000/books/2

Request body:
{
  "title": "Updated Book Title"
}

##### To delete a specific book by book id:
DELETE http://localhost:5000/books/3

### IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
Remember to adjust the URL and port (5000 in this case) if you're running the Flask server on a different address or port.
