# CRUD-API
API to handle basic Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) operations and Listing


To keep things simple, i am creating an API for managing a collection of books. I have assumed that each of the books has an id, title, author, and published_date.

Please use the program and continue to improve it as you see fit. 

Any suggestions are welcome on how this can be made better or maybe a better implementation of some of the functions.

### To try and run the program please read the "Running the API file".
